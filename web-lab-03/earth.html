   <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It has a diverse range of ecosystems, including forests, oceans, deserts, and mountains. The atmosphere, composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen, protects life and regulates temperature. Earthâ€™s surface is about 71% water, with the remaining 29% consisting of landmasses. The planet has a rich biodiversity, with millions of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms. Earth's unique conditions, such as its distance from the Sun and the presence of liquid water, make it an ideal home for life.</p>

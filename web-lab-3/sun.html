   <p>The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system and the primary source of energy for life on Earth. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, undergoing nuclear fusion at its core to produce immense heat and light. With a diameter of about 1.39 million kilometers, the Sun accounts for more than 99% of the solar system's total mass. It powers the Earth's climate and weather systems and has been a focal point of study and reverence for cultures throughout history. The Sun is expected to continue shining for about 5 billion more years before transitioning into a red giant and eventually becoming a white dwarf.</p>
